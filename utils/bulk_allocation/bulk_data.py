"""
Bulk Allocation Data Repository
===============================
Handles all data queries for bulk allocation including:
- Scope selection (brands, customers, products, ETD range)
- Demand data (OCs pending delivery)
- Supply data (Inventory, CAN, PO, WHT)
- Committed calculation with MIN logic
- Allocation status breakdown

REFACTORED: 2024-12 - Added OC creator info (oc_creator_email, oc_creator_name) 
                      from outbound_oc_pending_delivery_view for email notifications

BUGFIX: 2024-12 - Fixed HIGH VALUE FILTER: Changed unit_price_usd (non-existent) 
                  to outstanding_amount_usd (line 670)

FEATURE: 2024-12 - Implemented STOCK AVAILABLE FILTER that was missing (lines 643-663)
                   Now filters OCs to only show products with available supply

FEATURE: 2024-12 - Added get_supply_details_by_product() method for Supply Context UI

REFACTORED v3.0: 2024-12 - Simplified allocation logic using allocatable_qty_standard from view
    - Use allocatable_qty_standard directly from view (single source of truth)
    - Clear field naming: total_effective_allocated, undelivered_allocated, allocatable_qty
    - allocation_status from view with OVER_ALLOCATED state
    - Simplified over-allocation filter using over_allocation_type
